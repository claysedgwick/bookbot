# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

### Introduction

BookBot takes in a .txt file as an input and returns the total words count in the text, along with a sorted list of alphabetical characters by count in the text. The results are printed to the console and exclude non-alphabetical characters such as empty spaces and punctuation marks.

### Usage in Command Line Interface:

    python3 main.py <path_to_book>

Passing no book path or more than one book path will result in an error.

### Get Books

A large collection of eBooks to test this program can be found at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Simply search for a book that you are interested in, save the "Plain Text UTF-8" content as a .txt file on your system, and pass the path of this file into the program.
